Here the modelling is presented as described by Kendall. We consider a small element of time $dt$.


If $dt$ is small enough, an evolution of the system by a jump larger than one is highly unlikely and can be neglected.

The following possible evolutions are of interest: $N(t+dt)=N(t)+1$, $N(t+dt)=N(t)-1$, and $N(t+dt)=N(t)$.\\

The probability for the event $N(t+dt)=N(t)+1$ is: $\lambda \times N(t) \times \mathrm{d}t+o(dt)$ \\

The probability for the event $N(t+dt)=N(t)-1$ is: $\mu \times N(t) \times \mathrm{d}t +o(\mathrm{d}t)$ \\

The probability for the event $N(t+dt)=N(t)$ is: $1 - (\mu+\lambda) \times N(t) \times \mathrm{d}t +o(\mathrm{d}t)$ \\

\caption{Time continuous Markov model; the figure represents a system that has $n$ $(n\ge 1)$ species at time $t$ and  indicates the possible states at time $t+\mathrm{d}t$ as well as the probabilities associated with these transitions.} \label{fig:markov}

$P(N(t)=n)$, the probability of n species at time t, will be noted $P_n(t)$.\\


The following system of differential equations is deduced from these previous observations:

\begin{align}

&\frac{\mathrm{d}P_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}=P_{n-1}(t)\lambda(n-1)+P_{n+1}(t)\mu(n+1)-(\lambda+\mu)P_n(t) n \; ; \; n\ge 1 \\

&\frac{\mathrm{d}P_0(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}= \mu P_1(t)

\end{align}

An initial condition has also to be taken into account: the number of species at $t=0$, $n_0$ has to be known for the system being solved. We have then $P_{n_0}(0)=1$.\\

A birth rate, a death rate and an initial number of species are sufficient for describing a birth death process. 
Of course, in a stochastic framework the evolution of the process is not deterministic but it can be characterized by the 
expectation and the variance of the number of species over time. A birth death process will be noted $(\lambda,\mu,n_0)$.
